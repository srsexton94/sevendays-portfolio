## Future Goals
In my next edition of this project I would like to...
* re-write the bootstrap carousel from scratch in order to debug the loading issue currently present on initial load of the site.
* present this project series in the SEI08 Alumni Lunch & Learn and then add a website section to display an embedded recording of that presentation.
* write a proper email script for the contact form (need to write in PHP?) instead of just `action="mailto:..."`
* improve the mobile-responsiveness of the design (particularly the 'about me' and 'contact' sections)
